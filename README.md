# hello-world2
 Practically floored One of many zeros Kicked around, bored Your ears are full but you're empty Holding out your heart To people who never really Care how you are So give me coffee and TV, peacefully I've seen so much, I'm going blind And I'm brain-dead virtually Sociability Is hard enough for me Take me away from this big, bad world And agree to marry me So we can start over again Do you go to the country
